                        <p>
                            As a feature owner, I was responsible for planning and implementing new functionalities.
                            This involved breaking down the work into tasks, assigning responsibilities, and ultimately
                            delivering the features to the clients. My specific features are:

                            acceptance, mutual respect and attention for each team member. I also learned a lot from this.

                            In this role, I distinguished myself by being highly dedicated to our team and product.
                            I believe my efforts in time and work management helped set a positive example and
                            contributed to our overall success.
