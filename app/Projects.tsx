                    requests to different markets.
                    It executes trades based on the differences between exchanges in order to make profits. I have also
                    experience writing my own smart contracts on <strong>Solidity</strong> for other strategies.

                    Python scans the board. However, it was soo good (and bad at the same time) that after it reached
                    2100, it got banned :(

                    This project involves creating an infrastructure that includes an S3 bucket, a VPC with public and private subnets, a NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnets, and a Bastion host in the public subnet. Within the VPC, a MongoDB cluster is deployed in private subnets. Additionally, the project includes automatically building and containerizing server and web applications using Docker, which are then deployed and distributed across AWS Fargate.
