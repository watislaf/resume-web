## About Me 🌟
I’m a team player who loves getting things done. I’m always looking to improve myself and the team. I believe programmers sometimes focus too much on code and forget about the cost and profit, which can lead to overengineering.
I aim to find a balanced approach, making the code better and the product more profitable.

## Experience
I've been a Full-Stack Developer for 3 years, working on a variety of projects from startups to large products.

### My stack:
* Backend: NextJs (TRPC) | Spring, NestJS, NodeJs, occasionally Django
* Frontend: Mainly React and React Native, Tailwind (ShadCN)
* DevOps: AWS | Terraform | Firebase | Vercel (Coolify)
* Databases: MongoDB, PSQL

For modern projects, I prefer using Next.js, Tailwind CSS with ShadCN, TRPC, Drizzle ORM, and Coolify on Heroku.

# 💻 Professional Experience

### Full-Stack [Spring-React-ReactNative] Developer at [AVSystem](https://www.avsystem.com/)

*June 2022 - Present*

The work involved developing multiple IT products for a popular ice cream chain.
Our system was supported by only nine people, which placed significant responsibility on each team member and allowed us to work on all aspects of the end-to-end product.

**🛠 Stack**

The stack was very diverse. The project included an [application](https://goodlood.com/app/) for clients built with **React Native**, several [websites](https://goodlood.com/delivery/en) built with React in multiple frameworks, and various applications for internal use in ice cream production. The infrastructure featured several servers, with the main one developed in **Java Spring** and a smaller one in **Django**.

**📋️ My responsibilities**:
I began my career as a developer and naturally transitioned into the role of a feature owner.

As a feature owner, I was responsible for planning and implementing new functionalities. This involved breaking down the work into tasks, assigning responsibilities, and ultimately delivering the features to the clients.

My specific features are:

1) Implementing discounts and promo codes across the Client app, WebApp, POS and Backend.
2) Integrating our services with Shopify for new eCommerce functionality.

Be **agile**. It's hard not to notice that our team was built on pure communication, acceptance, mutual respect and attention for each team member. I also learned a lot from this.

**Summary**

In this role, I distinguished myself by being highly dedicated to our team and product, consistently striving to improve and innovate.
I believe my efforts in time and work management helped set a positive example and contributed to our overall success.

### Nokia Junior C++ Software Engineer 5g

*June 2021 - June 2022*

I worked on the 📡 5G-QoS project, which involved developing new network functionalities using C++. This role required a solid understanding of telecommunications and the ability to work with a large legacy codebase.

## 🚀️ Side Projects
Before my job and in my spare time, I worked on several startup projects.

### E-learning Platform
I implemented an online learning platform, that included the following applications:

1) A search-engine-friendly Knowledge Base built in Remix. The project generated static pages (with a 5-minute cache) based on a markdown template that could be publicly modified. It used Algolia as the search engine.
2) An e-learning fullstack Next.js app (using tRPC) with Clerk authentication utilizing [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/). Users can be assigned to teachers for lessons and homework tasks.

I handed off the project, and it’s currently not in production as it still requires content to be added by someone else.

### Crypto Arbitrage Trading bot
I implemented a self-hosted bot, written in ts, that uses crypto api library CCTX ([my contribution](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/pull/23461)) to handle websocket API requests to different markets.
It executes trades based on the differences between exchanges in order to make profits. I have also experience writing my own smart contracts on Solidity for other strategies. 

## 🏗️ Non-profit Projects
[Terraform Aws Infra](https://github.com/watislaf/dcms/tree/master/infra)
This Terraform training project involves creating an infrastructure that includes an S3 bucket for storage, a VPC with public and private subnets, a NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnets, and a Bastion host in the public subnet for secure SSH access. Within the VPC, a MongoDB cluster is deployed in private subnets for secure data storage. Additionally, the project includes automatically building and containerizing server and web applications using Docker, which are then deployed and distributed across AWS Fargate, enabling scalable and serverless management of the applications.

[Chess Bot](https://github.com/watislaf/chessbot)

This is a bot that I created in Python to play chess for me on [chess.com](http://chess.com/). The bot utilizes a **self-written** Chess Engine in C++ and using Python scans the board. However, it was soo good (and bad at the same time) that after it reached 2100, it got banned :(

### Team Project

February 2020 - May 2020

[Tower Defense Game](https://github.com/PGSStas/techvscats)

This is a 2D Tower Defence game written in C++. The game is designed for both PC and Android phones.

## 🎓 Education

BSc in Computer Science.

October 2021 - June 2025

Jagiellonian University at Krakow, Poland

I've worked full-time since my first year of studies. I considered dropping out because I believe real knowledge comes from experience, but the student privileges 😎 convinced me to stay. University only takes about 2 hours a week, so it barely affects my life.


### Childhood

I started programming when I was 14 years old. I graduated from one of the best lyceums in Belarus and won a silver medal in the Republic Olympiad in Belarus when I was 17.

### Expectancies
I have always been a dedicated worker. I'm looking for a high-demanding job with growth potential.

Thanks in advance.
