## About Me üåü

I‚Äôm a team player who loves getting things done. I‚Äôm always looking to improve myself and the team. I believe programmers sometimes focus too much on code and forget about the cost and profit, which can lead to overengineering.  
I aim to find a balanced approach, making the code better and the product more profitable.

## Experience

I've been a Full-Stack Developer for 3 years, working on a variety of projects from startups to large products.

### My stack:

* Backend: NextJs (TRPC) | Spring, NestJS, NodeJs, Django (occasionally)  
* Frontend: Mainly React and React Native, Tailwind (ShadCN)  
* DevOps: AWS | Terraform | Firebase | Vercel (Coolify)  
* Databases: MongoDB, PSQL

For modern projects, I prefer using Next.js, Tailwind CSS with ShadCN, TRPC, Drizzle ORM, Coolify.

# üíª Professional Experience

## Full-Stack Spring-React-ReactNative Developer at [AVSystem](https://www.avsystem.com/)

#### June 2022 \- Present 

The work involved developing multiple IT products for a popular ice cream chain.

#### üõ† Stack

The stack was very diverse. We had an [application](https://goodlood.com/app/) for clients built with **React Native**, several [websites](https://goodlood.com/delivery/en) built with **React** in multiple frameworks, and several applications for internal use in ice cream production. We had several servers, with the main one written in **Java Spring** and the smaller one in **Django**. Everything is hosted on **AWS** by using **Terraform**.

#### üìãÔ∏è My responsibilities:

I began my career as a developer and naturally transitioned into the role of a feature owner.

As a feature owner, I was responsible for planning and implementing new functionalities. This involved breaking down the work into tasks, assigning responsibilities, and ultimately delivering the features to the clients.

My specific features are:  
1\) Implementing discounts and promo codes across the Client app, WebApp, POS and Backend.  
2\) Integrating our services with **Shopify** for new eCommerce functionality.

Our system was supported by only nine people, which placed significant responsibility on each team member and allowed us to work on all aspects of the end-to-end product.

Be **agile**. It's hard not to notice that our team was built on communication, acceptance, respect and attention for each team member. I learned a lot from this.

#### Summary

In this role, I distinguished myself by being highly dedicated to our team and product, consistently striving to improve and innovate.

I believe I contributed value by setting an example in terms of time and work management.

## Nokia Junior C++ Software Engineer 5g

#### June 2021 \- June 2022

I worked on the 5G-QoS project, which involved developing new network functionalities using C++. This role required a solid understanding of telecommunications and the ability to work with a large legacy codebase.

## üöÄÔ∏è Recent Projects

Before my job, and in my spare time, I worked on several startup projects.

### E-learning Platform

I implemented an online learning platform that included the following applications:

1\) A landing page built in **Next.js**, utilizing [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) and **Tailwind** UI designs.  
2\) A search-engine-friendly Knowledge Base built in **Remix**. The project generated static pages (with a 5-minute cache) based on a markdown template that could be publicly modified. It used **Algolia** as the search engine.

I handed off the project, and it‚Äôs currently not in production as it still requires content to be added by someone else.

### Crypto Arbitrage Trading bot

I implemented a self-hosted bot, written in ts, that uses crypto api library CCTX \[[my contribution](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/pull/23461)\] to handle websocket API requests to different markets.  
It executes trades based on the differences between exchanges in order to make profits. I have also experience writing my own smart contracts on Solidity for other strategies.

##  üèóÔ∏è Old projects

### [Chess Bot](https://github.com/watislaf/chessbot)

This is a bot that I created in Python to play chess for me on [chess.com](http://chess.com). The bot utilizes a **self-written** Chess Engine in C++ and uses Python scans the board. However, it was soo good (and bad at the same time) that after it reached 2100, it got banned :(

#### [Aws Terraform training](https://github.com/watislaf/dcms/tree/master/infra)

 This project involves creating an infrastructure that includes an S3 bucket, a VPC with public and private subnets, a NAT Gateway for internet access from private subnets, and a Bastion host in the public subnet. Within the VPC, a MongoDB cluster is deployed in private subnets. Additionally, the project includes automatically building and containerizing server and web applications using Docker, which are then deployed and distributed across AWS Fargate.

### [Tower Defense Game](https://github.com/PGSStas/techvscats)

This is a 2D Tower Defence game written in C++. The game is designed for both PC and Android phones.

## üéì Education

### Jagiellonian University at Krakow, Poland.

##### BSc in Computer Science. October 2021 \- June 2025

I've worked full-time since my first year of studies. I considered dropping out because I believe real knowledge comes from experience, but the student privileges üòé convinced me to stay. University only takes about 2 hours a week, so it barely affects my life.

### Childhood

I started programming when I was 14 years old. I graduated from one of the best lyceums in Belarus and won a silver medal in the Republic Olympiad in Belarus when I was 17\.
